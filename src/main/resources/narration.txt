Those who say technology is the great enabler, forget it is a means, not an end.

Four months ago, a scientist in this facility discovered another world. A world of opposites.

We discovered that our world and this other world are linked. For every achievement in our world, a catastrophe happens in the other. Together the worlds achieve balance.

We began to build a machine that could open a door between the worlds. After two months we could open a hole stable enough to reflect a laser beam. After two more we could send a person.

After many arguments about who would go first, we decided to send everyone, while I was left behind as a failsafe. Hours later I recieved a message: WE HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED.

We feared this might happen; the evil of the other world corrupting the very soul of those who stay for too long. I cannot let them return. I must shut down the machine.
